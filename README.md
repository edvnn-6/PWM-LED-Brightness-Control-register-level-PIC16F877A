# PWM-LED-Brightness-Control-register-level-PIC16F877A
This project demonstrates LED brightness control using PWM on the PIC16F877A. The LED gradually increases and decreases brightness in a loop by varying the PWM duty cycle with smooth transitions. Ideal for learning PWM and embedded timing operations.
